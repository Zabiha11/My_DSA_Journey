# DSA Practice in Python

## Overview
This repository documents my structured journey to master Data Structures and Algorithms using Python.  
The goal is to develop strong problem-solving intuition and interview-ready coding skills through consistent daily practice.

Each day focuses on specific DSA concepts, followed by curated practice problems and optimized solutions.
