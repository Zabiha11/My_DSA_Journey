# DSA Practice — Day 1 (Arrays Foundation)

## Overview
Today marked the start of my Data Structures & Algorithms preparation using **Python**.  
The focus was on building a strong foundation in **array fundamentals**, understanding traversal patterns, and developing basic problem-solving logic using in-place operations.

I practiced problems on **GeeksforGeeks**, solved them independently through trial and error, and refined solutions to improve clarity and efficiency.

Total time spent: ~2.5 hours

## Topics Covered

- Array traversal and indexing
- Two-pointer technique for in-place operations
- Linear scanning patterns
- Basic condition-based early exits
- Frequency counting in sorted arrays
- Time complexity intuition for basic operations

---

## Problems Solved

### 1. Reverse an Array (Two-Pointer Technique)
**Goal:** Reverse the array in-place using constant extra space.

**Key Learning:**  
Introduced pointer convergence logic — swapping elements from both ends while moving inward.

---

### 2. Largest Element in an Array
**Goal:** Find the maximum element through linear traversal.

**Key Learning:**  
Maintaining a running maximum variable during iteration.  
Also learned to initialize from the first array element to handle negative values correctly.

---

### 3. Check if Array is Sorted
**Goal:** Verify whether the array is in non-decreasing order.

**Key Learning:**  
Comparing adjacent elements and using early termination to optimize performance.

---

### 4. Frequency of Elements in an Array
**Goal:** Count occurrences of each element.

**Approach:**  
Sort the array first, then count consecutive identical elements.

**Key Learning:**  
Nested while-loop pattern for grouped counting.

## Core Patterns Learned

- Linear traversal template  
- Two-pointer in-place swapping  
- Running variable tracking  
- Nested loops for grouped data  
- Edge case handling (single element, negative values)

---

## Challenges Faced

- Initial difficulty in structuring pointer loops  
- Debugging off-by-one index errors  
- Improving code cleanliness after achieving working logic  

These challenges helped strengthen my debugging mindset and logical clarity.

---

## Outcome

By the end of Day 1, I successfully:

- Built confidence in array traversal
- Implemented in-place modifications
- Understood foundational DSA thinking patterns
- Developed patience in debugging and iterative improvement

This day laid the groundwork for upcoming array manipulation and optimization problems.

## Next Step

Moving on to **Day 2**:
- Move zeroes to end
- Rotate array by K
- Remove duplicates from sorted array
- Find second largest element

**Consistency > Speed.  
Building logic one pattern at a time.**
