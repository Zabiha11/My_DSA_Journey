# Day 3 — Searching & Binary Search Patterns

## Overview
Day 3 focused on mastering search techniques in arrays.  
The objective was to understand linear search, introduce binary search logic, and explore search-based problem patterns commonly used in technical interviews.

All implementations were practiced in Python on GeeksforGeeks.

## Topics Covered

- Linear search in unsorted arrays  
- Binary search in sorted arrays  
- First and last occurrence detection  
- Counting occurrences of a target element  
- Lower bound and upper bound concepts  
- Searching in rotated sorted arrays  
- Transition from O(n) to O(log n) thinking

## Problems Solved

### 1. Linear Search
Performed direct element scanning to locate a target value.

**Key Concept:** Sequential traversal  
**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### 2. Binary Search
Implemented divide-and-conquer search on sorted arrays.

**Key Concept:** Low–High–Mid boundary reduction  
**Time Complexity:** O(log n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### 3. First and Last Occurrence of Target
Identified the starting and ending index of a given element.

**Key Concept:** Boundary tracking during search  
**Time Complexity:** O(n) (linear version practiced)  

---

### 4. Count Number of Occurrences
Counted frequency of a target value in an array.

**Key Concept:** Frequency counting through traversal  
**Time Complexity:** O(n)

---

### 5. Lower Bound Implementation
Found first index where element is greater than or equal to target.

**Key Concept:** Boundary-based searching logic  

---

### 6. Upper Bound Implementation
Found first index where element is strictly greater than target.

**Key Concept:** Threshold-based search logic  

---

### 7. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
Located an element in a rotated sorted array.

**Key Concept:** Search logic adaptation for shifted order  

---

## Challenges Faced

- Applying binary search variations beyond standard form  
- Distinguishing between linear and logarithmic search use-cases  
- Understanding boundary conditions for lower and upper bound  
- Conceptualizing rotated sorted array behavior  

---

## Learnings

- Binary search is a pattern family, not a single algorithm  
- Correct boundary updates are crucial for accurate results  
- Linear solutions build correctness; binary solutions build efficiency  
- Visualization of mid-pointer movement improves clarity  

---

## Outcome

All Day 3 problems were successfully implemented.  
Core understanding of searching techniques was established, with ongoing optimization towards full binary-search-based solutions.

## Next Step

Proceeding to Day 4:
- Prefix sum technique  
- Kadane’s algorithm  
- Sliding window patterns  
- Subarray sum problems  

Search foundation completed. Ready for range-based problem solving.
