# Day 2 — Array Rearrangement & Pointer Patterns

## Overview
Day 2 focused on mastering in-place array manipulation patterns.  
The objective was to strengthen pointer-based rearrangement logic, rotation techniques, and element tracking in single-pass traversals.

All implementations were practiced in Python on GeeksforGeeks.

---

## Topics Covered

- In-place rearrangement using pointers
- Array rotation using triple-reverse method
- Duplicate removal in sorted arrays
- Tracking first and second maximum elements
- Handling edge cases in linear scans
- Space vs time optimization awareness

---

## Problems Solved

### 1. Move All Zeroes to End
Rearranged array to shift all zeroes to the end while maintaining relative order of non-zero elements.

**Key concept:** Read–write pointer technique for in-place rearrangement.  
**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1) (optimized approach)

---

### 2. Rotate Array Clockwise by K
Rotated array elements to the right by k positions using the triple-reverse strategy.

**Key concept:** Segment reversal for in-place rotation.  
**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### 3. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
Removed duplicate elements from a sorted array using slow–fast pointer traversal.

**Key concept:** Two-pointer overwrite technique.  
**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### 4. Find Second Largest Element
Identified the second largest distinct element in a single traversal.

**Key concept:** Simultaneous tracking of first and second maximum values.  
**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

## Challenges Faced

- Converting extra-space solutions into in-place pointer solutions  
- Handling negative numbers and duplicate values  
- Ensuring correct pointer movement and boundary conditions  

---

## Learnings

- True interview-grade solutions prioritize O(1) space  
- Pointer-based thinking reduces unnecessary loops  
- Edge case handling is as important as main logic  
- Triple-reverse is a powerful rotation pattern  

---

## Outcome

All Day 2 problems were successfully implemented and optimized.  
Pointer intuition and in-place manipulation skills improved significantly.

## Next Step

Proceeding to Day 3:
- Linear search vs Binary search
- First and last occurrence in sorted arrays
- Lower bound / Upper bound patterns

Consistency locked in. Pattern instincts growing.
